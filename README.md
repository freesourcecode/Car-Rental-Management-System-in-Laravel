# Car Rental Management System in Laravel with Source Code

The **Car Rentals Agency** is a web application built using the Laravel framework and core PHP, with expressive and clean syntax.

To be really meaningful, we believe development must be a fun and creative experience.

**Car Rental Agency** takes the hassle out of renting a car by making routine chores in the agency easier, such as:

* **Customer registration:**

New users should be able to register online and print a membership card. Car reservation online: Customers should be able to book and reserve automobiles online using the system. 

Automatic database update if a reservation is made or a new customer is registered.

The system should be able to update the database without any further effort from the administrator whenever a new reservation or registration is made.

* **Customer feedback:** 

There should be a way for customers to provide feedback.

Moving on, this PHP-based vehicle rental project system is mostly concerned with dealing with consumers regarding their car rental hours and specific transactions.

Furthermore, it shows all available cars on the home page, whereas users cannot see unavailable automobiles until the rental car is returned.

Admin login, customer login, and staff login are the three sections of the project. In this web app’s overview, the employee has complete control over the system.

Customers can simply log in or register their accounts when it comes to the project.

He or she can see available cars, choose one, and rent it after specifying numerous criteria, dates, and other details.

After all, the consumer can rent a car by completing the necessary paperwork.
